Recently JFrog dopped support for older versions of TLS. https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/why-am-i-failing-to-work-with-jfrog-saas-service-with-tls-1-0-1-1/
We noticed that some of our internal Bamboo plans were failing where they were still using JDK7.
We were using the last public version of JDK7 version 80.

The builds were failing with:

    javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host closed connection during handshake

when Gradle was accessing public dependencies via *jcenter* through *Artifactory*.

*TLS1.2* is enabled by default in the current public versions of JDK8 so these versions were still building fine. 

I tried to enabled TLS via *JAVA_OPTS* as follows:

    JAVA_OPTS="-Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2" 

but apparently this only works when the correct java library calls have been made. Anything different has no effect and the TLS enabled version of JDK7 is required. This came into effect with *JDK1.7.0_131-b31*. All versions since the last public version have to be downloaded from Oracle support. https://java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml

Once the latest *JDK1.7.0_181* was installed on Bamboo and this version was referenced by the build, the problem was solved.

In Bamboo the JDK7 is installed and configured as a global variable *JAVA7_HOME*. The Bamboo task has an Environment variable configured as `JAVA_HOME=${bamboo.JAVA7_HOME}`. All JDK7 powered tasks automatically pick up the change.
