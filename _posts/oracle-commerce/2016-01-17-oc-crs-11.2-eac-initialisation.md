The Endeca Workbench in 11.2 has a new requirement to change the default password on first access.

So what happens if you follow the Commerce Reference Store (CRS) installation documentation, when you come to creating the Endeca application it installs but fails to initialise requiring you to change the password. If you then login to the workbench and change the password rerunning the process will still result in a 401 Unauthorized error similar to:

```
01.26.16 08:55:18] SEVERE: Unauthorized (401): Unauthorized access to workbench. Please check your credentials in WorkbenchConfig.xml/OCS. If problem still persists, please contact your administrator.
Occurred while executing line 3 of valid BeanShell script:
[[
1|
2|
3| IFCR.provisionSite();
4| CAS.importDimensionValueIdMappings("CRS-dimension-value-id-manager",
5| InitialSetup.getWorkingDir() + "/test_data/initial_dval_id_mappings.csv");
6|
]]
[01.26.16 08:55:18] SEVERE: Caught an exception while invoking method 'run' on object 'InitialSetup'. Releasing locks.
```

Oracle has a support doc available to guide you through setting the password and updating the Oracle Credentials Wallet. Log into your Oracle account and look for:

<i>On a New Oracle Commerce 11.2 Installation, initialize_services Script Fails With SEVERE: Unauthorized (401) (Doc ID 2075385.1)</i>

The password for the Workbench can be changed in the workbench itself or via a POST command. I've not used the POST command myself but you can try:

{% highlight bash %}
curl -FoldPwd=admin -FnewPwd=newpassword -FnewPwdConfirm=newpassword http://admin:admin@localhost:8006/ifcr/system/userManager/user/admin.changePassword.json
{% endhighlight %}

The change for the OCW looks like this according to the document:

Navigate to `$ENDECA_TOOLS_ROOT/credential_store/bin` and execute:

{% highlight bash %}
manage_credentials.sh add --config ../../server/workspace/credential_store/jps-config.xml --mapName endecaToolsAndFrameworks –-user admin --key ifcr --type password
{% endhighlight %}

and this doesn't work as is, so:

1. use ./manage_crendentials.sh to invoke the script
2. the parameters for --key and --user need to be switched around, so:

{% highlight bash %}
manage_credentials.sh add --config ../../server/workspace/credential_store/jps-config.xml --mapName endecaToolsAndFrameworks --key ifcr –-user admin --type password
{% endhighlight %}

(<b>Note:</b> don't put in your actual password, you will be prompted for it).

Once the passwords have been co-ordinated between the workbench and the OCW you can retry CIM or just run what CIM is running from the command line by navigating to:

`<path-to-endeca-apps>/CRS/control`

and executing:

{% highlight bash %}
$./initialize_services.sh --force
{% endhighlight %}
