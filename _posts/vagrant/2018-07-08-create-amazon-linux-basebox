Recently AWS released their Linux 2 and as part of that release included a downloaded VM for development and on-prem usage.
See https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/ for further details.

They also released a Docker image which I played with first: https://hub.docker.com/_/amazonlinux/
So I thought I would try create a Vagrant basebox from the VM.

Following the basic steps as described here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-2-virtual-machine.html I created the seed.iso and downloaded the VirtualBox image.

To create the basebox I did the following:

1. In the VirtualBox Gui, create a new VM and work through the settings screens
    - Name: AmazonLinux2
    - Type: Linux
    - Version: Linux 2.6 / 3.x / 4.x (64-bit)
    - Memory Size : Accept default size
    - Hard Disk: Create a Virtual Hard Disk now (default option) (Optionally select no VDI and accept warning)
    - Hard Disk File Type: Accept default - VDI
    - Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated
    - File location and size: Accept name and size
    - Click Create

2. In the newly created VM select Storage
    - Under Controller: IDE, select the Empty CD, Click the CD image on the right and choose your seed.iso created as per the AWS instructions
    - Under Controller: SATA, select the <name>.vdi disk, click the HDD image on the right and choose the amazon linux VDI downloaded as per AWS instructions.
    - Click OK to save

3. Start the new VM - double click the VM in the list. Once booted r
    - remove the seed.iso from the Storage options
    - Open the contents of the VirtualBox app. Uner the MacOs dir locate the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso and copy to another location
    - Add the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso as an optical drive
    - Restart the VM
    - login as root/vagrant
    - If requested run `sudo yum -y update` to update security patches
    - Mount the GuestAdditions: `mount -r /dev/cdrom /media`
    - `cd /media`
    - `./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`
    - this fails because the kernel headers are different

    Check the installed headers against the named headers
    - `uname -r`
    - `ls -la /usr/ssrc/kernel/<version>
    - Can try `yum downgrade kernel-headers`. This works but the above dir is unchanged and the problem still occurs.
    - look at /lib/modules/... and the symlinks to source and build are invalid due to the invalid version in /usr/src.
    - Here we get stuck at this point and can't continue ...

The rest below can be done when the kernel problem is fixed and the GA has been applied correctly.

Once the VM has booted login as ec2-user with the password added in user-data file in the seed.iso. Make a few changes as recommended by vagrant.
    - sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    - sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
    - sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
    - sudo visudo
        - ec2-user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
        - The line `Defaults requiretty` should be removed but it has already been removed.

4. Shut the VM down.

5. Navigate to your VirtualBox directory, e.g. `~/VirtualBox VMs` and use Vagrant to pack the VM into a basebox image.

    vagrant package --base AmazonLinux2 --output amazon-linux-2

6. Install the basebox. Use the same name as the VM or a different basebox name.

    vagrant box add --name amazon-linux-2 amazon-linux-2

7. In a new directory create your Vagrantfile
